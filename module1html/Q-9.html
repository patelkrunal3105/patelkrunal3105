<!-- Q-9 How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing?

Cellpadding:

Cellpadding specifies the space between the border of a table cell and its contents (i.e) it defines the whitespace between the cell edge and the content of the cell.

Syntax:

<table cellpadding="value" >.....</table>
where, value determines the padding 
(space between the border of a table and its content)
Cellspacing:

Cellspacing specifies the space between cells (i.e) it defines the whitespace between the edges of the adjacent cells.

Syntax:

<table cellspacing="value" >.....</table>
where, value determines the padding 
(space between adjacent cells)

<!-- Q-19 What is difference between HTML and XHTML? 


XHTML is a stricter, more standardized version of HTML, and the two are both popular markup languages for web development. Here are some differences between the two: 
Syntax: XHTML has a stricter syntax than HTML, and follows XML rules for formatting and structure. 

Case sensitivity: XHTML is case sensitive, while HTML is not. 
Closing tags: XHTML requires that all elements have a closing tag, while HTML allows some elements to be left open. 


Attribute values: XHTML requires that all attribute values are quoted, while HTML allows them to be quoted or unquoted. 

Error handling: XHTML has stricter error handling, while HTML is more forgiving. 
Document Type Definition (DTD): XHTML requires a DTD to be specified, while HTML does not. 

Future compatibility: XHTML is designed to be compatible with future technologies and devices, while HTML may not be as compatible. 

Nested tags: XHTML does not allow overlapping nested tag structures.

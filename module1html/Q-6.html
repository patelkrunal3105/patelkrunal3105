<!-- Q-6 What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML? 

The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element.

The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet. However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make changes to HTML elements with a specified class.


Example:

<html>
<head>
<style>
h1.intro {
    color: blue;
}

p.important {
    color: green;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 class="intro">Header 1</h1>
<p>A paragraph.</p>
<p class="important">Note that this is an important paragraph. :)</p>

</body>
</html>

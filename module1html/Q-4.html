<!-- Q-4 What are HTML Entities? 

HTML Entities are Character Sequences that represent Special characters or reserved characters in HTML


HTML entities offer methods to display reserved characters, ensuring correct rendering. Reserved characters, like ‘<‘, can create ambiguity if not displayed properly. HTML provides entity names and numbers for symbols not on basic keyboards (e.g., £, ¥, €, ©), resolving ambiguity and enabling accurate display.

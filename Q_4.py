# How memory is managed in Python?

# paython uses a techique called referance counting to keep treck of objects in memorey.
# Each object in python has a reference count associated with it, 
# which is incremented whenever a new reference to the object is created, 
# and decremented whenever a referance to the object is deleted or goes out of scope.

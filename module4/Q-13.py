#13.Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python?

''' 
Exceptions handling in Python is very similar to Java.
But whereas in Java exceptions are caught by catch clauses, we have
statements introduced by an "except" keyword in Python.

Python also allows you to create your own exceptions by 
deriving classes from the standard built-in exceptions.
